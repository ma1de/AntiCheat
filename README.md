WARNING: THIS ANTICHEAT ONLY DETECTS YOUR CLICK SPEED, IT DOESN'T DETECT ANY KIND OF RANDOMIZATION WHATSOEVER SO PLEASE DON'T DM ME ABOUT YOU BYPASSING WITH A CLICKER THAT CLICKS LESS THEN THE CPS LIMIT, ALSO IF YOU FLAG WHEN BUTTERFLY CLICKING THAT DOESN'T MEAN ITS A FALSE FLAG, IT LITERALLY SAYS THAT IT DETECTS CPS IN RANGE OF 16 AND MORE.
