# AntiCheat (CPS Detector)
This is an anticheat which can detect if your player is using an autoclicker with high CPS (In range of [16-Infinity]).

Features to add:
- /alerts and /debug command
- Configuration

This plugin also utilizes a library called PacketEvents (https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) (version 1.8.4). Thank you retrooper <3

If you have any issues with the plugin, please proceed to contact me on Discord (ma1de#4500) (Discord account ID: 454191600545824768).

Please don't make a bad review if you have an error in the console, just straight up dm me. I'm usually available from 2PM until 2-3AM (Check My Time Here). DM me whenever you have some free time and I will answer you once I will be able to.

# WARNING: THIS ANTICHEAT ONLY DETECTS YOUR CLICK SPEED, IT DOESN'T DETECT ANY KIND OF RANDOMIZATION WHATSOEVER SO PLEASE DON'T DM ME ABOUT YOU BYPASSING WITH A CLICKER THAT CLICKS LESS THEN THE CPS LIMIT, ALSO IF YOU FLAG WHEN BUTTERFLY CLICKING THAT DOESN'T MEAN ITS A FALSE FLAG, IT LITERALLY SAYS THAT IT DETECTS CPS IN RANGE OF 16 AND MORE.
